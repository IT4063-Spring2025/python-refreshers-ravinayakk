# ### Exercise
# write a python function that, given a year,:
# - returns the boolean value `True` if the year is a leap year
# - returns the boolean value `False` if it's not a leap year
# 
# Here's the criteria for a leap year:
# - If a year is evenly divisible by 4 means having no remainder, then go to the next step. If it is not divisible by 4, it is a common year.
# - If a year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, then it is a leap year. If a year is divisible by both 4 and 100, go to the next step.
# - If a year is divisible by 100 but not by 400, then it is a common year. If a year is divisible by both, then it is a leap year.

# ## Part 2: Numpy
# 🛑 Before you get started in this part, you need to make sure the library is imported 
# 
# (go back to the first cell and import `numpy` with `nb` as an alias)

# ### Exercise
# In one line and (one line only), create a numpy array that contains a range of evenly spaced intervals. Starting with number 3, ending with the number 15, with an intervals of 3
# > Output should look like `array([ 3,  6,  9, 12])`
# 
# 📜 [Here's a link to the `numpy.arange` function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html?highlight=arange#numpy.arange)

# In[16]:


np.arange(3, 15, 3)


# > 🚩 : Make a git commit here

# ### Exercise
# Given an array `some_array` of a certain shape, create another array of the same shape(size), where instead of the current value in the array, the string `IT4063C` would be there instead. For example For the array([1,2,3]), you would get an output of `array(['IT4063C' 'IT4063C' 'IT4063C'])`
# 
# 🦉 This can be solved by either using numpy.copy and numpy.fill together OR using numpy.full_like.
# 
# **Docs**
# - 📜 numpy.copy function
# - 📜 numpy.fill function
# - 📜 numpy.full_like function

# In[25]:

# ### Exercise
# To practice simple data transformation, work to concatenate 2 numpy arrays of strings. The arrays are of first names, and last names. The end results should be a single array concatenating the names into full names.
# 
# 🦉 I can't give you the answer directly. However, consider the following thought process.
# - What are the numpy functions that you can use?
#   - Check out the [Numpy Routines Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.html)
# - What's the difference between `numpy.concatenate` and `numpy.char.add`. and which one makes more sense to be used here?
# - you may find that a simple concatenation would look like this: array(['BobSmith' 'JaneJones' 'MalloryWilliams'])
# - Combine the previous exercises with this one, to make an array of empty spaces to be combined
# Also here are the documentation links to some `numpy` functions that, if pieced together, would solve the exercise.
# 
# - 📜 [`numpy.concatenate` function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.concatenate.html)
# - 📜 [`numpy.char.add` function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.char.add.html)
